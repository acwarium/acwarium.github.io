    I haven&#x27t been writing out my thoughts as most of the time it&#x27s boring. I reach conclusions that I think most people would have also gotten to. Lukewarm takes are pretty boring reads and are even more boring to write. But I still think I give things a fair trial. I wonder why it was that certain rules have their clauses or experiment with the potential thought process of another person that led them to their actions. It&#x27s something that I find myself doing regardless of the task, at least the non-mentally difficult ones. Like sitting in a slightly too warm car or waiting for a friend to get back to their computer. But along the way, there are some subjects that I have labeled as &#x27 delicate.&#x27

    In one&#x27s head, nothing is off limits. We try to refrain from thinking of things, but inside our skull is safe. You are free to think about anything in any way that you like. No one judges your opinions because right then, they aren&#x27t opinions. They haven't been fully realized. When you actually <b>say</b> something, people have societal permission to dunk on you if they deem your words incorrect or even just controversial. There are some with the mentality that won&#x27t censor their expression just to remain neutral or positive with others. At least, a portion of those only claim they do and won't bother to consider other's opinion. There are certainly people that actually do, but I wonder how that is done. Like I feel like it cannot be responsibly done without genuine consideration of their principles beforehand. If you just ignore people&#x27s opinion on a thing, I feel like you have surrendered a part of being a rational person.

    On a different note, articulation is really difficult for me. I find myself using the same words and phrases that I would use to describe completely different things. I have also noticed that I write in a way that even I don&#x27t find interesting. I hope I can change that at some point. Maybe it will be while writing in this blog, but I don&#x27t seriously believe that.

    Something that kinda freaks me out is that I am committing to writing and posting this on my website. I think of myself as a sensitive person. I think about things, which doesn&#x27t mean I end with the best possible choice or am claiming to be intelligent in any way. I just think about things. Preferably, I would like to gauge a person on how much they would like something I can introduce to them. I have friends spanning from those who might find this read interesting, and others who would get bored after 2 sentences. But having this post on my website is a way to prove to myself at least that I can say something. For now I will say it really is hot outside.
